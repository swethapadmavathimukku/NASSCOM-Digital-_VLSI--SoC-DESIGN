# DIGTIAL VLSI SoC DESGIN AND PLANNING

Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning refers to the process of designing and preparing a System-on-Chip (SoC) using Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) techniques, specifically focused on digital logic circuits.

>- This is a 2 week course of Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning with complete RTL2GDSII flow organised by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM

### HOW TO TALK TO COMPUTERS

ARDUINO : Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's designed to make digital electronics more accessible to hobbyists, students, engineers, and artists. Arduino boards are equipped with a microcontroller, which is a small computer that can read inputs (like sensors, buttons, or data from the internet) and turn them into outputs (like activating motors, lights, or displays).

The board shown in the image is the Arduino Leonardo, a microcontroller development board based on the ATmega32u4 chip, which is highlighted in the yellow circle. What sets the Leonardo apart from other Arduino boards is its built-in USB communication capability, thanks to the ATmega32u4â€™s native USB support. This allows the board to emulate USB devices like a keyboard, mouse, or joystick without requiring an additional USB-to-serial converter. It features 20 digital I/O pins (7 of which can be used for PWM), 12 analog inputs, and operates at 5V with a 16 MHz clock speed.
